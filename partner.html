								<p>Cambodia fund fundraisers are amazing, generous people who raise money to provide a better future for thousands of Cambodian children and their families.

                                <p>There are so many different ways to raise money for CCF – we’ve had people cycle across Asia, a whole family ran ultra-marathons in Iceland – but it doesn’t need to be extreme. Many people ask for donations for their birthday, or ask their friends and family to sponsor them to take part in a challenge.</p>

                                <p>Giving a helping hand is easier than you think. This guide will give you some fundraising ideas to support CCF on your own.</p>

<p>For larger fundraising efforts, we will even work with you to setup a “Fundraising Campaign” on the CCF website, which will allow donations to be made directly to your campaign via our donation platform. We will provide you with all the support you need, and we may even be able to profile your fundraising activities on the CCF blog and social media channels.</p>
